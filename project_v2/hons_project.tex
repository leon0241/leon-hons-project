\abstract{
   A popular technique for representing Concurrent Systems is categorised into models called Process Algebras. Many Process Algebras exist, and efforts have been made to contextualise different Algebra to each other to find out notions of which Algebra are ``better''.

   In this paper, we use the notion of ``expressiveness'', namely, ``Can one Algebra express more tasks than another'', and I present a translation between two popular Algebras, $\acp$ and $\csp$, that is valid up to a Rooted Branching Bisimulation equivalence.
